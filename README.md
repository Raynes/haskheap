# Haskheap

This is a simple Haskell library for easily interacting with the refheap API.

Currently WIP.

# Usage (reflects currently implemented functionality during WIP period)

```haskell
import Network.Haskheap

getPaste "1"
```

Note that the reason the id argument is a string and not a number is because
private paste ids are strings.
